<!-- ![Image of Mahiro from Onimai by sakura_planet on Twitter/X](./mahiro.jpg) -->
In sumamry, Kotenryuu is a creature who tries its best to commit but keep getting sidetracked despite having no ADHD, it's just bad at it. This document explains in depth about what it actually is and what it does.
## What does Kotenryuu speak?
This is not about programming languages, it's about human languages. Kotenryuu can speak:
- 󠁧English
- Indonesian
- Japanese
- Arabic
## What does Kotenryuu speak programmatically/code in?
Kotenryuu doesn't usually code, but currently it has a shallow knowledge of the following:
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

The shallow knowledge means that it has very little knowledge about libraries, but does grasps the pretty much the very basics of them. First language learned was [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) because it wanted to develop games with [3D Rad](http://3drad.org)(the game engine is abandoned somewhat and just *poofed*) and after that comes [C Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) because it was easier for beginner (trivia: Kotenryuu was 14 at that time!)
## What does Kotenryuu do?
- Working on a small [django](https://github.com/django/django) website
- Trying to create a game with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)
- Clips VTubers, mostly [Juufuutei Raden|儒烏風亭らでん](https://www.youtube.com/@JuufuuteiRaden) on its [YouTube clipping channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KotenryuuClips)
- Struggles to find time to draw, but did some drawing (is a wannabe artist).
## What does Kotenryuu likes?
- Kotenryuu likes anime and almost everything it watches are on its [MyAnimeList account](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kotenryuu).
- It likes to play games as well. Currently waiting for [Kemono Tea Time's](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698470/Kemono_Teatime/) release to watch the adorable pixels moving tenderly.
- Allegedly, likes coding in general, but has recently (kind of) been determined to focus more and make a real project to life.
